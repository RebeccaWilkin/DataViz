#**Rebecca Wilkin**
My name is Rebecca Wilkin and I am a student at Lehigh University where I am enrolled in a visual communication course. I am excited to learn about data journalism and data visualization. My goal for this course is to learn how to create stories through data and ultimately use this ability to strengthen my writing and reporting skills.
